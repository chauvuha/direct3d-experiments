### Steps to create a Window 
1. Install Visual Studio 
2. Create Program.cpp: Main program file where you'll call functions and set up your application. (where we will call Window.h later to render the window) (Where we create the window)
3. Window.h and Window.cpp:
- Window.h: Declare your window class, including its structure and methods.
- Window.cpp: Implement the functionality defined in Window.h, such as creating the window, handling messages (like mouse clicks or key presses), and managing the window lifecycle. (this is where we handle events)
4. Then compile & run program (console + window)
5. Outputting to both console and window: Console output provides immediate feedback and debugging information (like print statements), while the windowed application gives a visual interface for user interaction and more complex graphical output.

### Rendering the Triangle

1. First, we create three vertices to form a triangle.
2. Second, we store these vertices in video memory. Initially, the vertices reside in system memory, but for the GPU to access them efficiently, they need to be in video memory. To achieve this, we use a vertex buffer in Direct3D, which creates a copy of the data in video memory. If the data is not used for a while, the system may remove redundant copies.
2.1 We create a vertex buffer object.
2.2 We fill this vertex buffer object with the three vertices. (The vertex buffer stores raw vertex data (positions, colors, etc.).
3. Third, we instruct the GPU on how to interpret these vertices:
- In order for GPU to read the right buffer, it needs shaders as mini programs to do that. Shaders are small programs that control how the GPU processes rendering. Rendering is impossible without shaders. 
- So, we load two shaders and prepare them for the GPU. One is the vertex shader, which will later reads data from the vertex buffer and transforms it (e.g., applying projection, rotation, and translation). The 2nd one is the pixel shader, which takes those processed vertices and determines the final colors. The GPU then rasterizes (renders) the final image onto the screen.
4. Fourth, after loading the two shaders, we convert them into shader objects, create an input layout object that defines how the data from the vertex buffer should be passed into the vertex shader for the GPU.
5. Fifth, having this input layout object (which defines how the vertex buffer data is structured) and the vertex buffer, the GPU reads the vertices.
6. Sixth, we specify where on the back buffer the image should be drawn. The viewport determines which part of the back buffer is used for rendering.
7. Seventh, we finally render the triangle.

### How I implemented this is in the triangleRect.cpp file.
1. I experimented with the sample code from Direct3D 12 and was able to run the sln file in Visual Studio.
2. I also experimented with creating a rectangle next to the triangle and customized the colors.

3. Other notes:
- **How Visual Studio works**: We import the files into the **Solution Explorer**. Pay attention to the **Startup Project** by right-clicking on it and selecting **"Set as Startup Project"**. Also, check the **Build Configuration** (e.g., **x64 Release** or **Debug**) before pressing **F5** to build and run the project.  
- **Solution (`.sln`) files**: Each `.sln` file acts as a container for multiple smaller projects and defines how they should be run. Thatâ€™s why we need to open the `.sln` file and build from there.  
- **Direct3D demo**: The Direct3D 12 dependencies are located in the **packages** folder, so make sure to include them in the **Solution Explorer** when building.
