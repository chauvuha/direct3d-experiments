# Steps to create a Window 
1. Install Visual Studio 
2. Create Program.cpp: Main program file where you'll call functions and set up your application. (where we will call Window.h later to render the window) (Where we create the window)
3. Window.h and Window.cpp:
- Window.h: Declare your window class, including its structure and methods.
- Window.cpp: Implement the functionality defined in Window.h, such as creating the window, handling messages (like mouse clicks or key presses), and managing the window lifecycle. (this is where we handle events)
4. Then compile & run program (console + window)
5. Outputting to both console and window: Console output provides immediate feedback and debugging information (like print statements), while the windowed application gives a visual interface for user interaction and more complex graphical output.
