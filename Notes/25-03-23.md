### Todo
- [DONE] Fix this github so that it includes triangleRect as a folder with header, source, and .vcxproj in this folder. (Check why its not pushing HelloTriangle basically. So from "..\d3d12-hello-world-samples-win32\src\HelloTriangle\D3D12HelloTriangle.vcxproj" -> "HelloTriangle\D3D12HelloTriangle.vcxproj". It was probably outside of the repo thats why it wasnt pushed.
- [Ongoing] Continue learning graphics pipeline + more advanced concepts. Code up how to create a triangle from scratch.
